# This file has been auto-generated by Bake
# It contains preferences that you can customise
# You can also change the name of the target Bakefile

# If you want to regenerate this file: run bake with '-cfg' argument
# Remember: Bake is currently under development, so not all features might work!

# If you don't want to use the YAML file anymore, change it to false
# You can also set 'BuildFromYaml' mode to 'True'
# Setting BuildFromYaml to true will make it so that Bake bakes everything from here

Yaml: False
BuildFromYaml: False

# This is the function where you can specify build commands
[BuildFromYaml]
  - del_file: 'rm -rf foo bar'
  - spameggs: 'spam eggs'

# And this is the normal function if you are also using Bakefile
# Also, the 'default' value means the default stored in the program, so:
# Bakefile as name without an extension

# Remember to change 'default' to desired value
# And you need to specify a drive letter (i.e. X:\) if you're on Windows
